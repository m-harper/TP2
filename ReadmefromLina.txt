Read Me From Lina

I just added part named 'Agile works' on both product backlog and backlog for sprint 1.
The reason why I added it is agile works are also a part of this project.
But, if it is needless for backlog files or if it should be left out, please let me know, I'll modify it.

Also, for the initial burn down chart, I added planned amount column.
The entire estimated time was 61.75, so I just divided it by 12 which is remaining meeting days.
The 'Done Today' field for today (3/5/2013), I added 1.5 which is for burndown chart, and two backlog files(product backlog, backlog for first sprint).

If you have any opinion for the files above, please let me know before 8 pm, tomorrow.
(Or you can change it commit it directly!)
If it is okay, I'll upload the three files on csnet at 8 pm, tomorrow.

Thank you & See you on Wednesday!
